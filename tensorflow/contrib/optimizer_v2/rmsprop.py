"""RMSprop optimizer for Tensorflow.

rmsprop algorithm [tieleman2012rmsprop]

A detailed description of rmsprop.

- maintain a moving (discounted) average of the square of gradients
- divide gradient by the root of this average

mean_square = decay * mean_square{t-1} + (1-decay) * gradient ** 2
mom = momentum * mom{t-1} + learning_rate * g_t / sqrt(mean_square)
delta = - mom

This implementation of RMSProp uses plain momentum, not Nesterov momentum.

The centered version additionally maintains a moving (discounted) average of the
gradients, and uses that average to estimate the variance:

mean_grad = decay * mean_square{t-1} + (1-decay) * gradient
mean_square = decay * mean_square{t-1} + (1-decay) * gradient ** 2
mom = momentum * mom{t-1} + learning_rate * g_t /
    sqrt(mean_square - mean_grad**2)
delta = - mom

    Note that in the dense implementation of this algorithm, variables and their
    corresponding accumulators (momentum, gradient moving average, square
    gradient moving average) will be updated even if the gradient is zero
    (i.e. accumulators will decay, momentum will be applied). The sparse
    implementation (used when the gradient is an `IndexedSlices` object,
    typically because of `tf.gather` or an embedding lookup in the forward pass)
    will not update variable slices or their accumulators unless those slices
    were used in the forward pass (nor is there an "eventual" correction to
    account for these omitted updates). This leads to more efficient updates for
    large embedding lookup tables (where most of the slices are not accessed in
    a particular graph execution), but differs from the published algorithm.

    Some of the args below are hyperparameters, where a hyperparameter is
    defined as a scalar Tensor, a regular Python value or a callable (which
    will be evaluated when `apply_gradients` is called) returning a scalar
    Tensor or a Python value.

    Args:
      learning_rate: A float hyperparameter. The learning rate.
      decay: A float hyperparameter. Discounting factor for the history/coming
        gradient.
      momentum: A float hyperparameter.
      epsilon: A float hyperparameter. Small value to initialize the average
        square gradient variable and avoid zero denominator.
      use_locking: If True use locks for update operation.
      centered: If True, gradients are normalized by the estimated variance of
        the gradient; if False, by the uncentered second moment. Setting this to
        True may help with training, but is slightly more expensive in terms of
        computation and memory. Defaults to False.
      name: Optional name prefix for the operations created when applying
        gradients. Defaults to "RMSProp".
